Dotfiles for bash, vim, tmux and git. They're pretty messy, don't look at them :mask:

The only interesting thing here is how I like my bash prompt. Long pathnames in the prompt keep me up at night, and I don't like PROMPT_DIRTRIM so I rolled my own trimming logic. Also have the active git branch displaying, if inside a repo.
